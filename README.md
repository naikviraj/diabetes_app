## üìå Overview

The **Community Diabetes Risk Prediction App** is an interactive web application that helps users estimate their **risk of diabetes** based on lab parameters such as **HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, BMI, kidney function tests**, and more.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This app is for **educational purposes only** and **is not a substitute for professional medical advice**. Always consult a qualified doctor for health concerns.

## üõ† Features

- **Predict Risk:** Provides **Low, Medium, or High risk** of diabetes.
- **Probability Distribution:** Visualizes **likelihood of each risk category** using bar charts.
- **SHAP Explanation:** Explains **why the model predicted a certain risk** with feature importance.
- **Lifestyle Suggestions:** Personalized advice based on predicted risk.
- **PDF Report:** Download a **detailed report** of inputs, predictions, and recommendations.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Clean and responsive interface with interactive forms.
